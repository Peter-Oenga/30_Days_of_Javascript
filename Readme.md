# 🚀 30 Days of JavaScript – LeetCode Challenge

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my **30-day JavaScript learning journey** using **LeetCode challenges** as the primary practice platform.

The goal of this repository is not just to solve problems, but to **deeply understand JavaScript fundamentals**, especially how JavaScript works under the hood. Each challenge is approached with a **beginner-friendly mindset**, focusing on clarity, correctness, and explanation rather than shortcuts.

This repository is ideal for:
- Beginners learning JavaScript
- Developers revising core JavaScript concepts
- Anyone preparing for coding interviews involving JavaScript

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of these 30 days, I aim to:

- Build a **solid foundation in JavaScript**
- Understand key concepts such as:
  - Functions and closures
  - Scope and execution context
  - Rest & spread operators
  - Arrays, objects, and data types
  - Problem-solving patterns used in interviews
- Develop the habit of **reading problem requirements carefully**
- Write **clean, readable, and correct JavaScript code**

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each challenge in this repository follows a structured approach:

1. **Understand the problem statement**
2. **Break down the requirements in simple terms**
3. **Write a correct and readable solution**
4. **Explain the solution clearly** (as if teaching a beginner)
5. **Focus on JavaScript concepts involved**, not just passing the test

The emphasis is on **learning**, not speed.
